# React + Vite

A fun little game, in working, built with React and MobX for state management. The player navigates a tile-based map, defeat monsters to earn money, and purchase armor and weapons.
It includes real-time interactions, an inventory system, combat mechanics, and UI styling with SCSS. React handles the component structure, while MobX manages game state and updates.
